# Battle Tank Game
This is a training project using Unity's Battle Tank base artwork.
In this project I have implemented various Design Patterns and have tried to maintain a SOLID readable code. 
# The Design Patterns used in the project include:
  * Observer Pattern - Using Observer Pattern to create an Achievement System.
  * State Machine Pattern - Using State Machine pattern to create Enemy states.
  * Singleton Pattern - Using Singletons for managers or sevices.
  * Object Pool Pattern - Using Object Pool Pattern to create a pool for bullets.
# The project is also using MVC-S Architectural Pattern.
